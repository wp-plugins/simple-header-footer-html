A simple plugin for injecting HTML into various places in your Wordpress theme output.

== Description ==

This plugin is useful if you have want to enable your users to insert custom CSS or add custom headers or some JavaScript into the site without having to edit any theme files. Unlike similar header/footer plugins, this plugin by design does not allow to insert PHP code and does not contain any evil eval() calls. 

This plugin is made by [Seravo Oy](http://seravo.fi/), which specializes in open source support services and among others is the only company in Finland to provide [WordPress Premium Hosting](http://seravo.fi/wordpress-palvelu).
